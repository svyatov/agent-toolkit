# Browser Bugs Audit

Scan a frontend codebase for 50 documented cross-browser bugs and produce a prioritized fix report. Based on [Fifty Problems with Standard Web APIs in 2025](https://zerotrickpony.com/articles/browser-bugs/).

## Step 1: Determine Scope

Ask the user what to scan if not obvious from context:

| Trigger | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| Specific file or component | That file/component and its styles |
| "check my app" / "audit the frontend" | Scan all HTML, CSS, JS/TS in the project |
| Specific symptom ("audio broken on iOS") | Targeted scan for related bug patterns |

For project-wide scans, find frontend files first:

```
Glob: **/*.{html,css,scss,less,js,jsx,ts,tsx,vue,svelte}
```

## Step 2: Scan for Bug Patterns

Read `references/bug-catalog.md` for the full catalog of 50 bugs with detection patterns and fixes.

Scan code in four passes, checking each file against the relevant patterns:

### Pass 1: CSS / Styling

Search for these high-signal patterns across all stylesheets and style blocks:

- `100vh` or `100vw` without `dvh` fallback — **viewport units break on iOS** (#1, #2)
- `svh` or `lvh` usage — **broken on Firefox iOS** (#26). Prefer `dvh` instead
- `flex-grow` in scrollable containers without `flex-shrink: 0` on siblings — **Safari shrinks text** (#18)
- `::selection` for critical UI — **ignored on Safari iOS** (#30)
- `filter: blur()` on `<svg>` elements — **broken on Safari** (#31)
- Dark theme without `scrollbar-color` — **white scrollbars on Windows** (#40). Note: Safari still doesn't support `scrollbar-color` as of Safari 18, so `::-webkit-scrollbar` is also needed
- `:hover` for critical interactions (menus, tooltips with content) — **unavailable on touch** (#44). Fix with `@media (hover: hover)` scoping, add `:active` for touch feedback and `:focus-visible` for keyboard users
- Missing `touch-action: manipulation` on interactive elements — **double-tap zoom** (#42)
- `<button>` without explicit padding reset — **Safari adds extra padding** (#24)
- CSS custom properties in `background-image` on `::backdrop` — **Safari doesn't propagate** (#22). Still broken in Safari 18
- Missing `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` — **Firefox iOS cuts off bottom** (#27). Requires `viewport-fit=cover` in meta tag to work

Also check (older browsers — still report these, but at lower severity with a note about which versions are affected):
- `gap` with `display: flex` — unsupported on Safari < 14.1; ~96%+ global support (#17)
- `scroll-behavior: smooth` — ignored on Safari < 15.4 (#23)
- `transform: scale(%)` with percentage — breaks on Safari iOS 12 (#20)
- `lh` unit usage — unsupported on Safari < 16.4; use `em` fallback (#19)

### Pass 2: JavaScript / TypeScript

Search for these patterns in script files:

- `requestFullscreen()` without iOS detection/fallback — **disabled on iPhone, buggy on iPad** (#3–6). For iOS detection, the user agent string alone is unreliable — iPads report as macOS since iPadOS 13 (2019). Use:
  ```js
  const isIOS = /iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent) ||
    (navigator.maxTouchPoints > 1 && /Macintosh/.test(navigator.userAgent));
  ```
- `.play()` called outside user event handler — **blocked on iOS** (#12). The play-then-pause priming pattern inside a click handler is still the standard fix
- `.volume =` on audio elements — **non-functional on iOS** (#14). Still broken in iOS 18. Use `.muted = true/false` for muting; use GainNode for volume control
- `.pause()` or `.currentTime =` during pending `.play()` promise — **Chrome throws rejection** (#33). The MDN-recommended pattern: check if `.play()` returns a promise, `.then()` before pausing
- `navigator.clipboard` without feature detection — **missing on older Safari iOS** (#39). Fallback to `document.execCommand('copy')` (deprecated but still the only synchronous alternative)
- `element.focus()` on input in mobile context — **triggers soft keyboard** (#48). Don't use `'ontouchstart' in window` to detect mobile — touchscreen laptops expose it too. Use `matchMedia('(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)')` or avoid programmatic focus on inputs universally
- HTML5 drag-and-drop (`draggable="true"`) without touch fallback — **broken on iOS** (#7, #8). Recommend established libraries: **SortableJS** (vanilla/framework-agnostic) or **dnd-kit** (React). Hand-rolling touch events is error-prone
- `MouseEvent.shiftKey` in mobile interaction paths — **never true on mobile** (#45)
- OscillatorNode without gain envelope — **pops on Firefox** (#34). Still valid; use `linearRampToValueAtTime` for fade-in/out

Also check (older browsers — still report these, but at lower severity with a note about which versions are affected):
- `new AudioContext()` without `webkitAudioContext` fallback — Safari dropped the prefix in 14.1 (Apr 2021) (#35)
- `element.animate()` without fallback — Web Animations API is native since Safari 13.1 (2020) (#32)
- `ResizeObserver` without fallback — native since Safari 13.1 (2020) (#21)
- `inert` attribute without fallback — native since Safari 15.5 (2022), Firefox 112 (2023) (#37). If supporting older browsers, use the **wicg-inert** polyfill (`npm install wicg-inert`) rather than a CSS hack — `pointer-events: none` doesn't trap focus or hide from the accessibility tree
- Material Icons via ligatures without `font-feature-settings: "liga"` — only needed for Safari < 13 (2019). Consider recommending Material Symbols (variable font, no ligatures) as the modern alternative (#16)

### Pass 3: HTML / Structure

Check HTML files and templates:

- Missing `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` — **mobile rendering breaks** (#25)
- System font names (Arial, Courier, etc.) without `woff2` fallback — **inconsistent rendering** (#15)
- Draggable `<span>` that can wrap lines — **garbled drag image on Safari** (#38)
- UI text using "click" without touch-aware alternatives — **confusing on mobile** (#43)

### Pass 4: Design Review (judgment-based)

These aren't grep-able — assess by reading component logic:

- Scrollable containers without visible scroll indicators — **invisible scrollbars on iOS** (#9). CSS scroll shadows (`background-attachment: local`) are the best pure-CSS approach (works on iOS 15+)
- Small touch targets (< 44px) without invisible hit-area expansion — **iOS miss-taps** (#10). Minimum 44px per Apple HIG and WCAG 2.2 AAA; 48dp for Material apps
- AudioContext with OscillatorNode — **routes to ring volume on iOS, pops on Firefox** (#11, #34)
- Audio elements played more than once — **first 300ms cut on Safari replay** (#13)
- Soft keyboard overlapping important context — **50%+ screen consumed** (#46, #47)
- Desktop-only layout without responsive breakpoints — **unusable on phone** (#49)
- Reliance on CSS absolute units (`cm`, `mm`) — **don't match real measurements** (#50)
- Pinch-zoom without `position: fixed` root — **missing pixels after zoom** (#29)
- Fullscreen + scroll — **exits fullscreen on Safari** (#5)
- Fullscreen + keyboard input — **keyboard blocked on Safari** (#6)

## Step 3: Generate Report

Produce a severity-ranked report. Group findings by severity, then by file.

### Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Criteria |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **P0 — Broken** | Feature silently fails | Audio won't play, fullscreen crashes, API missing, content cut off |
| **P1 — Degraded** | Feature works but poorly | Text shrinks, scrollbars invisible, 300ms audio skip, wrong font |
| **P2 — Cosmetic** | Visual glitch only | Extra button padding, white scrollbars, drag image garbled |
| **P3 — Design** | Design anti-pattern | Hover-dependent UI, click vs tap wording, no responsive layout |

### Report Format

```markdown
# Browser Compatibility Audit

## Summary
- **X issues found**
  - P0 — N
  - P1 — N
  - P2 — N
  - P3 — N
- Most affected platforms: [list]
## P0 — Broken (N)

### [Bug title] (#N)
- **File**: path/to/file.ext:LINE
- **Pattern found**: `code snippet`
- **Impact**: What breaks, on which browser/platform
- **Fix**:
  ```diff
  - problematic code
  + fixed code
  ```
- **Library/polyfill** (if applicable): package name and install command

## P1 — Degraded (N)
...

## P2 — Cosmetic (N)
...

## P3 — Design (N)
...
```

For each finding, provide a concrete diff showing the fix — not just a description. When a well-known library or polyfill exists for a problem, recommend it by name with an install command.

## Step 4: Offer to Apply Fixes

After presenting the report, offer to apply fixes grouped by severity:

> "Found X issues. Want me to fix all P0s now? I can also fix P1s and P2s — P3s require design decisions so I'll just flag those."

Apply fixes carefully — some are one-line changes, others require restructuring. For fixes that need design decisions (like replacing hover menus with click-to-toggle), explain the tradeoff and let the user choose.

## Notes

- Always report all issues found, including ones that only affect older browsers. For legacy issues, note which browser versions are affected so the user can decide relevance. Don't omit them — the user may be targeting older browsers or kiosk devices. Do assign them lower severity (P2/P3) when they only affect browsers with < 1% market share.
- Some fixes conflict — e.g., `svh` fixes viewport on Safari but breaks on Firefox iOS. The report should note when a fix introduces a different bug.
- The bug numbers (#N) reference the original article for context. Include them so the user can read more.
- For iOS detection, never rely solely on user agent strings — iPads report as macOS since 2019. Use `navigator.maxTouchPoints` combined with user agent.
- For mobile detection (e.g., avoiding focus()), use `matchMedia('(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)')` instead of `'ontouchstart' in window` — the latter triggers on touchscreen laptops too.

### Recommended Libraries & Polyfills

When a bug has a well-known library/polyfill solution, recommend it over hand-rolled fixes:

| Problem | Library | Install | Notes |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Drag-and-drop touch support | SortableJS | `npm install sortablejs` | Vanilla JS, framework-agnostic |
| Drag-and-drop (React) | dnd-kit | `npm install @dnd-kit/core` | Best touch support for React |
| `inert` polyfill (Safari < 15.5) | wicg-inert | `npm install wicg-inert` | Proper focus trapping + a11y |

Most other APIs (ResizeObserver, Clipboard, Web Animations, smooth scroll) are natively supported in all current browsers and no longer need polyfills as of 2025.

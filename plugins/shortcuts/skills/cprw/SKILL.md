Branch and status: !`git status --short --branch`
Changed files: !`git diff HEAD --stat || true`
Branch commits: !`git log --oneline origin/HEAD..HEAD || true`
Recent subjects: !`git log --oneline -10 || true`

Commit everything above, push, open a pull request, and merge it once CI is green. Never commit onto
the default branch. The lines above describe the session's working directory. When this session's
work sits in another worktree (`git worktree list`), run every step there with `git -C <path>` and
leave the changes above untouched.

1. Read the full diff (`git diff HEAD`), every untracked file `git status` lists, and, when
   `Branch commits` lists any, their diff (`git diff origin/HEAD...HEAD`) before writing anything.
2. Scan it for credentials, tokens, private keys, and any value that does not belong in this
   repository. If you find one, stop, commit nothing, and report what you found.
3. If the current branch is the repository's default branch, create and switch to a new one first:
   `type/kebab-description`, where `type` matches the Conventional Commit type you are about to use
   and the description comes from the change itself.
4. Stage the changes. Prefer explicit paths over `git add -A`.
5. Write a Conventional Commit `type(scope): description`, matching the subject style already in
   `git log`. Follow the `oss-writing` skill for the wording. $ARGUMENTS is a hint at what the change
   is about, not the message itself.
6. Commit, then `git push -u origin HEAD`.
7. `gh pr create`. The squash merge makes the title the one commit on the default branch, so the
   title and body cover the whole branch: your commit's subject when it is the branch's only
   commit, otherwise one Conventional Commit subject spanning every commit. Use the repository's
   pull request template when it has one.
8. `gh pr checks --watch` until every check settles. It exits non-zero on failure, so allow that and
   read the result rather than treating it as a crash.
9. Green: `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`. When the branch is checked out in a worktree,
   `--delete-branch` cannot delete it: first confirm `git -C <worktree> status --short` is empty,
   then `git worktree remove <worktree>` and merge from the main checkout. Red: stop, name the
   failing check and the reason, and merge nothing. Do not retry, do not fix, do not merge past a failure.
10. Report the PR URL and whether it merged.

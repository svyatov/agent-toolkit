Branch: !`git status --short --branch`
PR checks: !`gh pr checks 2>&1 || true`
Recent runs: !`gh run list --branch "$(git branch --show-current)" --limit 5 2>&1 || true`

1. Nothing red: say so and stop.
2. `gh run view <id> --log-failed` for every failing job. Read the whole failure, not the last line.
3. Reproduce locally when the repository has the same check (test suite, linter, build). Fix the root
   cause in the code or the workflow. Do not retry, skip, or mark the check as allowed to fail, and do
   not loosen the check so it passes.
4. A failure that is not ours (flaky runner, upstream outage, expired secret): report it and stop.
5. Commit the fix as a Conventional Commit following the `oss-writing` skill, push, then
   `gh pr checks --watch` (it exits non-zero on failure, so allow that and read the result). Still red
   after one round: report what remains and stop.
6. Report what failed, the cause, the fix, and the rerun result.
